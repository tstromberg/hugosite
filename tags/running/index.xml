Today, my legs feel sore and stiff, as if I am walking around on knees made up of chipped pallasite.
I trained for two months, but as you can see from the above chart, I only ran past the 7-mile range once.
I can make all sorts of excuses as to why I didn&amp;rsquo;t train more, but a significant reason for it was pain.</description></item></channel></rss>
