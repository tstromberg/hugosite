![me](me.jpg)

Born in Sweden, raised in the United States, and settled in San Francisco.

I've spent most of my career attempting
to replace myself with a tiny shell script. This includes a 15-year stint at Google,
where I worked in a variety of positions across Hardware Operations, Site Reliability Engineering, Security, and Cloud.

My primary interests are open-source software, cycling, and photography.
