Remember the 1990's? 

When folks blessed with bandwidth setup shell servers, and invited their friends to share in the bounty?

I just moved into a new house, and discovered that I was in this scenario again, for the first time in 20 years.

Today, open-source developers need bandwidth less than access to dev & test environments that differ from their own. What if I combined the two ideas together to create something new?

Thus was born the idea of the Kernel Cafe: Public Cloud Native Infrastructure, run by volunteers.

It's not yet clear to me whether this idea has legs, but you can follow along here to watch.
