      <description>After dumping 60 hours into hand-carving a custom bicycle frame, I can say with high probability that you probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do so. Before I convince you of this, let me describe how I went about it.
A brief history of my bike builds Five years ago, while recovering from a broken foot, I ordered the Calfee DIY Bamboo Bicycle Kit to give me something to do. The kit provides the bamboo, the tools, the diagrams, and instructional videos.</description>

      <title>My first 15k: San Francisco Hot Chocolate Run</title>

      <description>Yesterday, I ran further than I have ever run before: 15k (9.6mi). Today, my legs feel sore and stiff, as if I am walking around on knees made up of chipped pallasite.
[img &amp;ldquo;Miles vs. Date.png&amp;rdquo;]
I trained for two months, but as you can see from the above chart, I only ran past the 7-mile range once.

I can make all sorts of excuses as to why I didn&amp;rsquo;t train more, but a significant reason for it was pain.</description>

      <title>The anatomy of a great playbook entry</title>

      <description>What if you could easily reduce the length of outages by 3X?
According to the SRE book, &amp;ldquo;recording the best practices ahead of time in a playbook produces roughly a 3x improvement in MTTR&amp;rdquo;. This improvement mirrors my experience with well-written playbooks.
So what makes a playbook entry &amp;ldquo;great&amp;rdquo;?
Philosophy Remember how you felt in your first on-call rotation, when you were paged at 3am for a system you barely understood?</description>

      <title>Motivating Software Engineering Teams</title>

      <description>Empathy, purpose, craftsmanship.
Empathy The key to motivating a team is to identify what motivates the people that make up the team, with enough empathy to put yourself in their shoes.
Everyone wants to be happy, but everyone has their unique path to happiness. Learning the career and life goals of everyone on the team allows you to prime the right tasks for them at the right time.
Asking people directly, &amp;ldquo;What motivates you as a software engineer?</description>

      <title>Tesla Model Y: family camping in below-zero temperatures</title>

      <description>TL;DR: If you think outside of the box, you can sleep 4 with full climate control for a cost of 10-12% battery usage per night, even in freezing temperatures.
When we bought our Tesla Model Y in December, the intent was to roughly recreate the experiences of our trusty 1971 VW Bus, but in electric form.
With all the cargo space, and the availability of great mattress options, such as the Tesmat, one can get pretty close to a passenger-van conversion.</description>

      <description>Originally posted on my personal blog in April 2020I wanted to get my feet wet with understanding Kaniko, an open-source in-cluster builder for Docker images. I happen to work with one of the maintainers, Tejal, and I asked her if there was any interesting UNIX-internals sort of bugs that might be interesting.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the mystery issue: &amp;ldquo;The USER command does not set the correct gids, so extra groups are dropped&amp;rdquo;. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example to reproduce it:</description>

      <title>Persistent multi-user Docker on macOS</title>
      <link>https://stromberg.org/t/posts/2021/persistent-multi-user-docker-on-macos-32em/</link>

      <description>First, be aware that docker is not designed to be securely shared among multiple users. Please assume that anyone who has access to docker is effectively equivalent to `root&#39;.
This assumes that users will be interacting with docker via the command-line, rather than graphically. It also assumes that the environment is such that allows a single user to be automatically logged into via the GUI, but this is mostly out of laziness rather than an underlying technical restriction.</description>

      <title>kernel café, toward alpha 1</title>
      <link>https://stromberg.org/t/posts/2021/kernel-cafe-toward-alpha-1-28m6/</link>

      <description>I spent some time today in the data-hall, getting lighting setup, as well as a console. This weekend I aim to get the rack-boards installed on the walls.
Here are the alpha milestones I aim to reach before the service becomes initially shareable:
 Week 1: Initial network setup, first node with SSH cert sync Week 2: Tinkerbell setup and second node: Honeycomb LX2, installed via Tinkerbell. Trusted testers. Week 3: Third node: Mac Mini Week 4: Nodes 4 &amp;amp; 5, Public Kubernetes Cluster Week 5: Segregate Firewall, resource controls  Beta!</description>

      <title>Dreaming of a Kernel Cafe</title>

      <description>Remember the 1990&amp;rsquo;s?
When folks blessed with bandwidth setup shell servers, and invited their friends to share in the bounty?
I just moved into a new house, and discovered that I was in this scenario again, for the first time in 20 years.
Today, open-source developers need bandwidth less than access to dev &amp;amp; test environments that differ from their own. What if I combined the two ideas together to create something new?</description>

      <title>Supply vs Demand</title>
      <link>https://stromberg.org/t/posts/2021/supply-vs-demand-20e7/</link>

      <guid>https://stromberg.org/t/posts/2021/supply-vs-demand-20e7/</guid>
      <description>When running public service as a free-time effort, it is critical to consider supply &amp;amp; demand as early on in the process as feasible.
For most folks:
 &amp;lsquo;supply&amp;rsquo; is the resources you can sink into the service &amp;lsquo;demand&amp;rsquo; is what the public wants out of this service  If you structure your service in such a way that demand immediately outstrips supply, you may have to quickly pivot in a manner that is disruptive to your users.</description>
