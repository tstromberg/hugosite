<p>Yesterday, I ran further than I have ever run before: 15k (9.6mi). Today, my legs feel sore and stiff, as if I am walking around on knees made up of chipped pallasite.</p>

<p>I trained for two months, but as you can see from the above chart, I only ran past the 7-mile range once.</p>

<p>I can make all sorts of excuses as to why I didn&rsquo;t train more, but a significant reason for it was pain. After about 5 miles, I began to feel significant pain where the (medial|lateral) collateral ligaments met the fibula. This pain would last for days after a run. Running the actual Hot Chocolate 15k was no exception.</p>
<p><img src=start.jpg alt="The starting line"></p>
<p>The day of the run was compatively smooth. The starting line was only a 20-minute walk away, so I went directly in without checking any gear. Once at the starting point, the line was divided up in groups based on the expected lap time we signed up with: 12:00/mile pace, in my case. 14-minutes after the first group left, ours did as well.</p>

<p>The actual run didn&rsquo;t cover any new ground for me, as Golden Gate Park has been my stomping ground for cycling and running for the last 10 years. The weather was a perfect 55&rsquo;F (13&rsquo;C), and the sun was out. Roughly every 3 miles there was a rest stop with water, gummy bears, marshmellows, and best of all: bathrooms!</p>

<p>The detour down the Great Highway toward the Zoo gave us a glimpse of the ocean, albeit buried behind the sand dunes:</p>

<p>At the 7-mile mark, I began to feel tired - like I really had to push myself up the hill to go on. At the 8-mile mark, I was tired, but everything was autopilot.</p>
<p><img src=trio.jpg alt="Tom, Little Bird, and myself"></p>
<p>At 9-miles, some familiar folks were waving to me: my wife & kids! It wasn&rsquo;t difficult to coax the youngest to run the final 0.6mi (1km) to the fininsh line with me.</p>
<p>So, why did I run? I blame my good friend and long-time cycling partner, Tom. He&rsquo;s been running the Hot Chocolate for 7 years now. He had previously coaxed me into it 5 years ago, but unfortunately I broke my foot a few weeks ahead of the actual run.</p>
<p>Would I recommend the Hot Chocolate Run? Most definitely. The experience certainly has me thinking about the viability of running a Half Marathon later this year.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Tom Kocon & Peter van Vugt for all the peer pressure and training.</p>
